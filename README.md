🍔 Food Image Classification System
📌 Overview
This project is a deep learning-based Food Image Classification System that identifies different food items from images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of food images. The model can classify images into multiple food categories with high accuracy.

🚀 Features
✅ Classifies images into multiple food categories 🍕🍔🥗
✅ Uses a pre-trained CNN model (MobileNetV2, ResNet, or EfficientNet)
✅ Supports real-time predictions
✅ Works with custom food images
✅ Can be deployed using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit
